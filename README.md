# py_games
Games on Python: Snake, FizzBuzz, etc.

In this repository I'll put my code of simple popular games on Python.
You have to download actual packages for the games such pygame using -conda or -pip installers.

Being a data analyst I'm using Jupyter Notebook for coding on Python but it's not the best solution for game development.
